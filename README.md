# Virtual-Machine-API-Implementation
In this projects, we implemented a virtual machine to support multiple user space preemptive threads. 
The virtual machine mutex API provides synchronization mechanism and file access is provided through the file API. 
The virtual machine also has the ability to create, allocate, deallocate, query, and delete memory pools. 
At the end we added the ability to mount and manipulate a FAT file system image.
